# ðŸ¤– Agentic RAG System
## Multi Source Intelligence Platform

An advanced, multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines vector search, autonomous reasoning, real-time data sources, and modular agent orchestration to solve complex queries. This project is designed as a production-grade AI system and is ideal for demonstrating real-world applications in AI, blockchain analytics, and intelligent automation.

## ðŸš€ Key Features & Architecture

### ðŸ”¹ Multi-Agent System
- **Planner Agent**: Decomposes complex queries into manageable research tasks.
- **Retriever Agent**: Searches semantic vector databases for relevant content.
- **Crypto Agent**: Connects to the Etherscan API to retrieve live blockchain data.
- **Web Agent**: Gathers real-time data from the internet.
- **Reasoner Agent**: Performs logical reasoning and multi-step analysis.
- **Synthesizer Agent**: Compiles responses from all agents into a coherent, factual answer.

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Capabilities
- Real-time agent status updates and monitoring
- Multi-step reasoning with confidence scoring
- Autonomous agent orchestration based on query type
- Source attribution and fact-checking
- Interactive query interface with example prompts

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

- **API Integration**: OpenAI and Etherscan APIs are fully embedded.
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search powered by ChromaDB or compatible vector stores.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Status tracking and streaming responses via websockets or console outputs.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Optional frontend with a glassmorphism design (can be built in Streamlit or React).
- **Production-Ready Code**: Modular, extensible codebase with error handling and scalability features.
